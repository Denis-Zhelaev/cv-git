### About Me
**Years of Study:** 2020â€“2025  
**University:** [Volga State University of Technology (PGTU)](https://www.volgatech.net/)  
**Specialization:** 09.03.04 "Software Engineering"

#### Specialization Description:
Software Engineering is a field that prepares specialists for the development, implementation, and maintenance of software systems. The program focuses on both theoretical foundations and practical skills, enabling students to design, develop, and test software solutions. Key areas of study include:

- **Software Development:** Learning programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, and Python.
- **Web Development:** Mastering frontend (HTML, CSS, React) and backend (Node.js, Flask, Django) technologies.
- **Databases:** Working with SQL (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases.
- **DevOps:** Understanding containerization (Docker), CI/CD pipelines, and cloud technologies.
- **Project Management:** Gaining experience in Agile, Scrum, and Kanban methodologies.
- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:** Exploring data analysis, neural networks, and AI algorithms.

#### My Experience:
I have extensive experience working with C-like languages (C, C++, C#), which I prefer for their performance and versatility. I also have practical skills in:
- **Node.js:** Building scalable backend solutions.
- **Blender:** Creating and animating 3D models, which has given me a solid understanding of 3D graphics and design.

#### My Ambitions:
I am planning to pursue a Master's degree to deepen my knowledge in software engineering and specialize in backend development. I prefer C-like languages because they offer high performance and are widely used in system programming, game development, and high-load applications. I am also interested in:
- **Backend Development:** Building efficient and scalable server-side applications using C# and Node.js.
- **Game Development:** Exploring tools and frameworks for creating interactive 3D environments, as well as backend solutions for multiplayer games.

#### Example of My Work:
The website [astrent12.ru](https://astrent12.ru) is a project where I implemented an admin panel for managing a news feed. The backend was written in C#, and I used SQLite for data storage and JWT tokens for authentication (stored in `localStorage`).

#### Soft Skills:
- **Problem-Solving:** I enjoy tackling complex challenges and finding innovative solutions.
- **Teamwork:** I collaborate effectively with others, whether in academic projects or personal initiatives.
- **Adaptability:** I quickly learn new technologies and adapt to changing requirements.
- **Communication:** I clearly articulate ideas and actively listen to feedback.
